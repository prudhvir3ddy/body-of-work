December 2023 - Present

### Summary 

- I am the engineer who focused on _Getting things done_ and helped the organisation move faster with good-quality work.
- I started as an Android engineer, but eventually had to do full-stack ( Android + iOS + React + Ruby + Golang + AWS ) as we are a small team but with a lot of product work. 
- I'm the only person in the org who made decent contributions on all 6 public-facing apps - restaurant, rider, and consumer ( Android + iOS )


### No one asked me to do

When I joined the restaurant team, everyone was discussing how they wanted to do a full rewrite of the app, as the current app is very old and not scalable, and there's a proposal to leadership as well.

I'm not a fan of rewrites. I took a bet and, in my free time ( after delivering features actively ), I worked on doing the safe refactoring of the app.

These are things which I did 

- Introduce Jetpack Compose to the codebase with the org's design system support, which not only supported the refactoring but also improved developer productivity
- A lot of Android Lint checks to avoid mistakes made previously
- Migrated the codebase to Dagger Hilt, which cut down ~50% of boilerplate code in the codebase
- Introduced coroutine support and deprecated the RxJava foundation
- Deprecated a lot of the Base* class and wrote its composition alternatives

All these wouldn't be possible without the help of two other amazing engineers in the team who believed and supported my decisions
